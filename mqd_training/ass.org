** One Exchange, Two Markets (Bdl, Euro MTF)

The Luxembourg Stock Exchange operates two markets: the
EU-regulated Bourse de Luxembourg (BdL) market and the
exchange-regulated Euro MTF market. Learn about the main
differences between the two markets.

When listing on the Euro MTF market, the Luxembourg Stock
Exchange is in charge of prospectus approval and the prospectus
is drawn up according to our own rules and regulations. When
listing on the BdL market, Luxembourgâ€™s financial regulator, the
Commission de Surveillance du Secteur Financier (CSSF), reviews
and approves a prospectus.

By being outside the scope of EU regulations, issuers on the Euro
MTF market benefit from less stringent requirements for financial
reporting.

However, only issuers that list on the BdL market have access to
EU passporting, meaning that the same prospectus approval can be
used to list on other EU exchanges.
